On success this endpoint returns the full assembled `PersonRecord`.

### Specification
See the [IVMS101 standard](https://www.intervasp.org/) for full field definitions and compliance details.

### Validation

- [Create a transaction](https://docs.range.org/api-reference/transactions/create-a-transaction.md): 
  Submits a signed transaction for broadcast.

  Faraday routes the transaction based on the `from_network` key from the quote. 

  - The transaction must already be signed by the sender before submission.
  - The endpoint will broadcast the transaction to the selected blockchain
  network and return the result.
  - This endpoint does not modify or re-sign the provided transaction — it
  broadcasts exactly what is submitted.

- [Get a quote](https://docs.range.org/api-reference/transactions/get-a-quote.md): 
Retrieves a best price quote from multiple quote providers:

The service selects the best available route based on price and execution
parameters.

Along with the quote, the response includes:

- An unsigned transaction ready for signing.
- A risk report generated by Range's Machine Learning models, designed to
help mitigate fraud and compliance risks.

If travel_rule_compliant is true, Faraday will verify that both the sender
and recipient have valid IVMS101 person records stored. If these records are
missing or invalid, the request will fail with a validation error (422).

- [Get a transaction](https://docs.range.org/api-reference/transactions/get-a-transaction.md): 
Retrieves a single processed transaction by its unique transaction hash.

Note transactions must be submitted via the Faraday API to be available on this endpoint. 

### Response
Includes:
- Transaction hash
- Network (e.g., Solana, Ethereum)
- Amount (in base units)
- Travel Rule compliance status
- Timestamp of creation or observation
- Full IVMS101 sender and recipient records, if available

### Notes
- If IVMS101 records are missing, `sender` or `recipient` will be `null`.
- Use this endpoint to audit a transaction or verify compliance.

- [Get quotes](https://docs.range.org/api-reference/transactions/get-quotes.md): 
 Retrieves all available quotes from from quote providers

- Uses the same address/amount inputs for all providers.
- Risk assessment is computed once (same inputs) and attached to the response.
- If `travel_rule_compliant` is true, verifies IVMS101 records for sender & recipient before quoting.

- [List transactions](https://docs.range.org/api-reference/transactions/list-transactions.md): 
Returns a list of processed transactions with associated sender and recipient IVMS101 records, if available.

### Response
Each transaction includes:
- **Transaction hash**
- **Amount** (in base units)
- **Travel Rule compliance flag**
- **Timestamps**
- Full **sender** and **recipient** records, if present

### Notes
- Transactions are returned in **descending order of creation** (most recent first).
- If IVMS101 records are not found, `sender` or `recipient` fields may be `null`.

- [Track transaction status](https://docs.range.org/api-reference/transactions/track-transaction-status.md): 
Returns the status of a transaction by hash.  

The `status` key of the response provides a status of the transaction which is one of

- submitted
- pending
- completed
- failed
- abandoned
- unknown

The `raw` key provides the full response from the provider, which may provide additional information including links to block explorers and intermediary transactions. As each provider response is different it is up to clients to parse raw provider responses to use them. 

### Query Parameters
Clients that did not submit their transaction via the Faraday API can still use this endpoint by providing:

- **tx_hash** *(required, path)* — The transaction hash on the source chain.
- **quote_id** *(optional, query string)* — If the transaction originated from a Faraday quote, include the quote UUID to link to the original quote record.
